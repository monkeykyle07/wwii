<p>The duties of fire watchers were not to ‘watch fires’ but to look out for
 incendiaries and extinguish them before a fire could take hold. A law in September 1940 required factories and businesses to appoint employees to watch for incendiary bombs outside of working hours. 

Incendiary bombs were quite small. They were dropped, hundreds at a time. On impact they ignited and burned.

Fire Watchers were issued with a bucket of sand, a bucket of water and a stirrup pump.
